                     This paper focuses on real-time object detection systems, analyzing existing FielProgrammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) implementations that aim to achieve the best efficiency, performance,
and accuracy at the same time.<mark>These three metrics are typically</mark>  crucial for domains   such as autonomous
driving, and robotics. Fortunately, recent advancements in object detection models, particularly based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), <br>have significantly improved object detection accuracy and speed.
When these models are combined with FPGAs, it is possible to achieve even more power efficiency and more
easily satisfy real-time constraints. FPGAs can deliver low latency and high throughput by leveraging true
parallelism making them suitable platforms for developing real-time object detection systems. This paper
reviews existing literature on FPGA-based real-time object detection,<br> discussing commonly used algorithms,
acceleration techniques, and optimization strategies. Evaluation metrics and typical datasets for assessing
real-time systems are also examined.<br> We have compared the performance of these implementations by using
pixel throughput as a fair metric across different systems while processing video streams or images. Insights
into state-of-the-art works, comparative analysis, <hr> challenges, and future research directions are provided to
guide researchers interested in leveraging FPGA devices for 
<em>real-time                    object detection applications</em>
